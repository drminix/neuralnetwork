# Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of deep neural network written in Python3.

General DL methodology can be defined as below:
1. Initialize parameters(W,b) and define hyper-parameters (learning-rate, number of iterations, and etc)
2. For given number of iterations
    1. Perform forward propagation
    2. compute the cost function
    3. Perform backward propagation to compute the gradients
    4. Update the parameters using gradient descent method
3. Use trained model to predict labels
